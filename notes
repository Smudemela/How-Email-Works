## How Does an Email Get From One Place to Another?

Email delivery relies on several protocols and sets of rules that show how data is communicated between devices. The email protocols are **SMTP**, **IMAP**, and **POP3**.

- **Protocol:** A set of rules that makes data communicate between devices.

### Key Email Protocols

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending emails from the sender’s device to the email server and between servers.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Used for receiving and managing emails. It syncs your inbox and folders across multiple devices.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3):** Used for receiving emails. It downloads emails from the server to your device and usually deletes them from the server.

### Step-by-Step: How Email Travels

1. **Compose:** The sender writes an email using an email client (like Outlook, Apple Mail, or a web browser).
2. **Send:** The email is sent to the sender’s SMTP server.
3. **DNS Lookup:** The SMTP server surrounds the DNS server to find the recipient’s mail server (translating the domain name to an IP address).
4. **Spam & Policy Checks:** The email passes through spam filters and policy checks.
5. **Routing:** The email is routed to the recipient’s mail server (MX server).
6. **Delivery:** The recipient’s mail server stores the email in their inbox.
7. **Download & Sync:** The recipient’s device uses IMAP or POP3 to access the email. IMAP syncs all folders and messages; POP3 only downloads the inbox.
8. **Read:** The recipient opens and reads the email.

## What Do These Protocols Do?

- **SMTP:**  
  - Sends emails from your device to the server and between servers.
  - Validates messages and attachments for compliance with email policies.

- **IMAP:**  
  - Receives and manages emails.
  - Syncs your entire mailbox (inbox, sent, folders) across devices.
  - Allows you to access your email from multiple devices.

- **POP3:**  
  - Receives emails by downloading them from the server to your device.
  - Typically removes emails from the server after download.
  - Best for accessing email from a single device.

## Ways to Access Email

- **Email Clients:**  
  - Examples: Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird  
  - Installed on your device for managing emails.

- **Web Browsers:**  
  - Access email through webmail services (like Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook.com) using a browser.

## Additional Info

- **Attachments:** Emails can include files, images, and documents.
- **Spam Filters:** Most email systems automatically filter out unwanted or suspicious emails.
- **Security:** Many email services use encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect your

## Email Security & Best Practices

### Security Measures
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Protects emails during transmission
- **SPF Records:** Prevents email spoofing
- **DKIM:** Provides email authentication
- **2FA:** Two-factor authentication for account security

## Email Security Measures

### SSL/TLS Encryption
- **What it is:** Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security
- **How it works:**
  - Creates a private, encrypted connection between email servers
  - Like putting your letter in a locked box that only the recipient can open
  - Shows up as "https://" and a padlock icon in your browser
- **Why it matters:** Prevents others from reading your emails while in transit

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- **What it is:** Email authentication method
- **How it works:**
  - Lists which servers are allowed to send email from your domain
  - Like having an approved list of post offices that can send mail with your return address
  - Example SPF record: `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`
- **Why it matters:** Stops scammers from pretending to be you

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- **What it is:** Digital signature for emails
- **How it works:**
  - Adds an invisible digital signature to every email
  - Recipient's server verifies the signature
  - Like a wax seal on a medieval letter
- **Why it matters:** Proves emails haven't been tampered with during transit

### 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
- **What it is:** Two-step verification process
- **How it works:**
  - Something you know (password)
  - Something you have (phone, security key)
  - Like needing both a key and a PIN to open a safe
- **Why it matters:** Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account

### Together, these create multiple layers of security:
1. SSL/TLS protects the content
2. SPF verifies the sender
3. DKIM ensures message integrity
4. 2FA secures account access
