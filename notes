## What is Email?
Email is a quick and convenient way to write and send someone a message over the internet. 
We can just write someone a message using our computer tablet or smartphone.

### How does an Email Get From One Place to Another?
---
Email is received and sent by using a couple of different protocols.
Protocols are just a set of rules that a service follows in order to function. 
These email protocols are IMAP, POP 3 and SMTP. 

Protocol - a set of rules that govern data communication between devices

SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

IMAP - Internet Mail Access Protocol

POP3 - Post Office Protocol 3 (IMAP alternate)

1. The sender sends a email to the email client.
2. Reaches the SMTP server, then it goes the DNS server. DNS server translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling email routing.
3. Spam & Policy checks
4. MX server gives route and mail goes to the domain
5. Gets to inbox of user 
6. POP3 or IMAP downloads what's in your inbox to your
device (IMAP is prefered)
7. user see the mail and reads

### What Do These Protocols Do?

SMTP: 
    - used for sending email

    - validates the message and
      the attachments to make sure it's in
      compliance with the email policy 

IMAP: 
    - used for receiving email 

    - downloads what's in your inbox to your
      device but it also downloads and syncs 
      your entire email folder structure so
      whatever is in your inbox sent items

POP3: 
    - only downloads the contents of your
      inbox folder which is where your email is
