## How Does an Email Get From One Place to Another?

Email delivery relies on several protocols and sets of rules that show how data is communicated between devices. The email protocols are **SMTP**, **IMAP**, and **POP3**.

- **Protocol:** A set of rules that makes data communicate between devices.

### Key Email Protocols

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending emails from the sender’s device to the email server and between servers.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Used for receiving and managing emails. It syncs your inbox and folders across multiple devices.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3):** Used for receiving emails. It downloads emails from the server to your device and usually deletes them from the server.

### Step-by-Step: How Email Travels

1. **Compose:** The sender writes an email using an email client (like Outlook, Apple Mail, or a web browser).
2. **Send:** The email is sent to the sender’s SMTP server.
3. **DNS Lookup:** The SMTP server surrounds the DNS server to find the recipient’s mail server (translating the domain name to an IP address).
4. **Spam & Policy Checks:** The email passes through spam filters and policy checks.
5. **Routing:** The email is routed to the recipient’s mail server (MX server).
6. **Delivery:** The recipient’s mail server stores the email in their inbox.
7. **Download & Sync:** The recipient’s device uses IMAP or POP3 to access the email. IMAP syncs all folders and messages; POP3 only downloads the inbox.
8. **Read:** The recipient opens and reads the email.
